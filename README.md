## Bench Marking Tests ##

The PyNEMO module can be tested using the bench marking scripts in the inputs folder. To check the outputs of the benchmark test can be visualised using the plotting script within the test_scripts folder.

- Run PyNEMO using the namelist file in the inputs folder (namelist_remote.bdy)

- This will create two output files coordinates.bdy.nc and NNA_R12_bdyT_y1979)m11.nc

- To check the coordinates.bdy.nc has the correct boundary points, the script bdy_coords_plot.py will plot the domain boundaries and shown the different locations of the rim width (increasing number should go inwards)
